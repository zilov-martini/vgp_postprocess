# Task 14: Replace fastalength with Custom Python Implementation

## Original Request
i dont like using fastalength because it is a tool from exonerate package, lets write simple python script which outputs the same and apply it to the pipeline, do not forget to add log of task

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Created Custom Sequence Length Calculator
- Developed sequence_length.py with:
  * Memory-efficient single-pass implementation
  * No sequence storage in memory
  * Matches fastalength output format exactly
  * Simple error handling
  * Pure Python implementation (no external dependencies)

### 2. Pipeline Integration
Modified core pipeline components:
1. Workflow Updates:
   - Updated workflow.py to use sequence_length.py
   - Maintained sort functionality for consistent output
   - Kept memory allocation parameters unchanged

2. Dependency Management:
   - Removed fastalength from env_checker.py required executables
   - Added sequence_length.py to required pipeline scripts
   - Updated DEPENDENCIES.md to reflect changes

### 3. Script Implementation Details
- Uses generator-based FASTA parsing
- Processes files line by line for memory efficiency
- Calculates lengths without storing sequences
- Matches fastalength output format:
  ```
  <length> <header>
  ```
- Simple command line interface:
  ```bash
  python sequence_length.py <fasta_file>
  ```

## Files Modified
1. pipeline/scripts/sequence_length.py (new)
   - Created efficient sequence length calculator
2. pipeline/workflow.py
   - Updated fastalength job to use new script
3. pipeline/utils/env_checker.py
   - Removed fastalength dependency
   - Added sequence_length.py to required scripts
4. pipeline/DEPENDENCIES.md
   - Updated dependency documentation
   - Added note about custom sequence length implementation

## Benefits
1. Reduced external dependencies
2. Pure Python implementation
3. Memory-efficient processing
4. Consistent with original output format
5. Easier pipeline portability
6. Simplified installation requirements

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding tests for sequence_length.py
2. Document script in pipeline README
3. Consider adding progress reporting for large files
4. Consider adding multi-threading for very large files if needed
