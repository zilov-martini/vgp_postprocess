# Task 10: Environment Testing

## Original Request
Test environment checker in current environment

## Test Results

Executed environment check with:
```bash
python3 pipeline/pipeline.py --test_env
```

### Issues Detected

1. Missing Executables:
   - gfastats
   - fastalength
   - bsub (LSF)
   - bjobs (LSF)

2. Missing Environment Variables:
   - JIRA_TOKEN
   - JIRA_SERVER

3. LSF Issues:
   - LSF commands not found in PATH

### Implementation Verification

✓ Logging works correctly
✓ Environment checking detects missing tools
✓ YAML configuration loads successfully
✓ Error reporting is clear and actionable
✓ Python package dependencies installed correctly
✓ Directory structure validation works

### Setup Steps Required

To run the pipeline, users need to:

1. Install required tools:
   ```bash
   # Install gfastats and fastalength
   # Install LSF if using cluster submission
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export JIRA_TOKEN="your-token"
   export JIRA_SERVER="your-server"
   ```

3. Add LSF to PATH if using cluster:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/path/to/lsf/bin:$PATH"
   ```

## Conclusion

The environment checker successfully:
1. Detects missing dependencies
2. Provides clear error messages
3. Lists required setup steps
4. Prevents pipeline execution if environment is not ready

This helps users identify and fix environment issues before running the pipeline, reducing runtime errors and improving user experience.
